# inverted-pendulum-on-a-cart-control-with-PD-LQR-MPC
This repository provides MATLAB code to explore control methods for an inverted pendulum, an underactuated system. Implemented controllers include PD (linear), LQR (optimal), MPC (predictive), and an Energy-Based swing-up strategy to ensure stability from far-from-equilibrium initial states.
